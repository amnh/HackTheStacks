The location of the Hall of Birds of the World is somewhat confusing. It appears that the hall first exhibited in Floor 2, Section 1 as early as 1904 and as late as 1945. It also occupies Floor 2, Section 2 from 1927 to the current day. However, Mammals and Birds exhibited on Floor 2, Section 2 in 1904."

The renovated  exhibition halls will not only provide a showcase for the Museum's worldfamous collection of dinosaurs and other vertebrate fossils but will also enhance visitors' 
understanding of evolutionary and biological concepts. These halls will reopen to the public as they are completed, beginning with the Halls of Early and Late Mammals in 1993"" (1990 AR p. 1). "

""The gem collection consists of the exhibits made by the Tiffany Company at the Universal Expositions held at Paris in the years 1889 and 1900.

Especially noteworthy are the series of Corundums (Sapphires), Topazes, Beryls, Garnets and Tourmalines...Uncut gem materials and crystals are exhibited in connection with gems. Observe the assemblage of cut and carved semi-precious stones, such as Rhodonite, Jadeite and Jade, and several forms of Quartz, especially Rock-crystal and Amethyst...The Morgan Collection of gold coins of the United States is here, containing a nearly complete series of the issues from the Philadelphia mint. The Copper Queen case exhibits a wonderful series of specimens donated by the Copper Queen Consolidated Mining Company from their mines at Brisbee, Arizona"" (page 16).
Morgan Halls of Mineralogy were originally located on Floor 4, Section 2 and West Corridor in 1904. Minerals from Section 2 moved to Section 4 before being remodeled to hold general Collection of Minerals and Morgan Gem Collection (1922 General Guide, page 119). Gems from the Morgan Collection were exhibited in the West Corridor of Floor 4 from 1904-1921. The Morgan Memorial Hall of Gems was constructed in the 1970s on the first floor of the museum (Floor 1, Section 8)."
